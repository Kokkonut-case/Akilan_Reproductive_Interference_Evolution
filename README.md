The simulation_class makes use of the parameters instance of this class to run the simulation. The parameters class is instantiated in the base_parameters file. The base_parameters file is then imported into the Birth rates, competition coefficients, initial trait values, initial population numbes, evolvabilities, all of them are defined here. \n",
